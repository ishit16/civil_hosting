      <h1>My Journey with the IITB Seismic Team</h1>
      <p>
        I am Shashank Nyol, a fourth-year dual degree student with
        specialization in Structural Engineering. I was the captain of IITB
        Seismic Team which participated in the Seismic Design Competition 2023
        held at San Francisco in the United States. This article gives an
        overview about my complete journey right from joining the team to
        leading it and about my visit abroad.
      </p>

      {/* Journey Through the Team */}
      <h2>My Journey Through the Team</h2>
      <p>
        I joined the team when I was in 3rd semester. I got to know about the
        recruitment information through email, which mentioned about the
        competition briefly and how the IIT Bombay won “The Spirit of the
        Competition Award” during its debut participation. There wasn’t a
        rigorous selection procedure in place, the email was just a call for
        enthusiastic students. I found my interests aligned right away as I was
        going through the email, because during that time I was looking for
        opportunities to explore the core field. So fairly enough, this was an
        opportunity knocking at my door! And in response, I didn’t hesitate to
        express my interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since, there were no formal selections, we were assigned to learn ETABS
        software right away through weekly meetings. As time progressed, we were
        assigned more mature roles of modelling the building on software and
        this was the point when I could make sense of some concepts which I was
        learning through courses. I was intrigued by the fact that, how even the
        basic knowledge from 1st and 2nd year courses could be utilized to
        handle some challenging design constraints in the building. That was the
        post-covid time and the competition was postponed from its usual in
        April to June. Consequently, we did not have a hectic workload during
        the semester. Until that time the modelling and analysis of building on
        software had been completed. The exhaustive preparations started in May,
        after the endsem exams. It was the time to begin construction. And
        before beginning construction, we had to devise the methodology, which
        could entertain the challenges posed due to small size of members,
        intricate connections and could comply to the precise quality
        requirements. Believe me, this was a much more difficult task to
        accomplish than what it seems on paper!! Those were the times when I
        literally used to dwell in the EM lab (a lively working place at ground
        floor of CED), with frequent visits to TL for fabricating members. I
        even have pictures of Divyansh, sleeping on the lab table :). Finally,
        after days of ill-scheduled sleep and hard efforts, we packed and sent
        off the model to USA. Nobody could go there to represent our college due
        to covid constraints. But gracefully, one university generously agreed
        to handle our model there and the management approved it. I took the
        responsibility of giving oral presentation about the building’s design,
        which was one of the judging criteria. Following it, was the shake day,
        and our heartbeats were at all-time high. It was a huge relief, when we
        saw that the model survived both shakings, leaving space only for pride.
        On our success, we received appreciation from the HOD and our faculty
        advisor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, it was the time for me to relax for some months since the autumn
        semester was not hectic in regard of the competition. During December,
        the communication regarding next edition of the competition had arrived.
        I decided to take the leadership role during this time. It was a tough
        call, against the fact that other tech teams of our institute are led by
        4th year students. But I took it, with the belief that I had already
        landed into responsible roles during previous year, due to the absence
        of a proper structure in place, since the team is young and in its
        building up stage. For beginning the new session, we held recruitment in
        November. Following it, we started working on the design proposal in
        December, which is the first phase of the competition, and an important
        screening criterion before securing invitation.
      </p>

      {/* Leadership Role */}
      <h2>Leadership Role</h2>
      <p>
        During the next edition's preparations, I decided to take the leadership
        role. We held recruitments, worked on the design proposal, and
        kickstarted the work in the Spring semester of 2023. Intense
        preparations, testing the damper, and finalizing the design followed.
        The construction was more intense this time as it coincided with my
        exams. After shipping the model, Divyansh and I flew to the USA for the
        competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We kickstarted the work with the beginning of Spring semester 2023, with
        a fun filled informal all team meet to formally welcome the new members
        and familiarize with each other. Me and the senior team members planned
        to have daily work sessions during night in the EM lab, skipping as
        minimum days as possible. Which, was motivated from the culture of IITB
        Racing Team. Alongside, we also insisted junior team members to attend
        those sessions on regular basis. Our first target was to prepare the
        damper proposal, for which we went on to build from scratch a friction
        damper completely by ourselves. Since, we only had a month’s time to
        succeed in this new venture, there were only limited tests which we
        could perform, those also, with the challenge of operating the shake
        table for the first time. Due to those reasons combined, we couldn’t
        obtain the desired results from the damper. This was not a setback, but
        a stepping stone for future teams to come and utilize the learnings from
        our experience. Moving forward with our preparations, we finalized the
        building’s design before the midsem exams. Right after midsem, we began
        the construction of trial model, whose purpose was to be tested on shake
        table to predict the response of the actual model. After having intense
        discussions with Mr. Khan, who was the former in charge of Heavy
        Structures Laboratory, and had gained immense experience by assisting
        many alumni for their thesis projects that involved working on shake
        table, we began the preparations for testing. Soon, the day of testing
        had arrived, something of the sort never experienced by any of us
        before, and so all the phone cameras were focusing on the model to
        ensure that no angle got missed. After the first test went as per our
        expectations, we continued for multiple tests further. Thereafter, we
        had all the conclusions made out from testing results handy, and after
        brainstorming on a few required structural modifications to the final
        design, one of which came surprisingly from Prof RS Jangid during his
        visit to the lab, we built the final structure. I could feel the recap
        of previous year, where many of us cut short our sleeps during the
        construction of the final model, addressing many challenges and failures
        which had come on our way, where we had to repeat the same process for
        hours. This time it was even more intense. The reason being that, it was
        the first week of April and I had to complete my study for endsem a
        priori to departing for USA, since I was to return after my first exam.
        After shipping the model, it was me and Divyansh, who were filled with
        unbridled enthusiasm to fly off to the opposite part of the world!!{" "}
      </p>

      {/* San Francisco Experience */}
      <h2>San Francisco Experience</h2>
      <p>
        We departed on 8th April from Mumbai. Upon reaching the skies of San
        Francisco, I was awed by the spectacular scenes offered by one of the
        most advanced parts of the world. The fact that it was my first visit
        abroad, added even further to the wonder and satisfaction. We ensured a
        good rest after reaching our hotel to recover from the 16hr long flight.
        The competition had to begin from next day continuing for 4 days. The
        models of all colleges had to be reached to the competition’s
        destination till that time. But unfortunately, ours didn’t reach. A
        welcome event was held on the first day, where I was briefed about the
        timelines of events for the upcoming three days. During this time, all
        the teams were unpacking their shipped models and displaying their
        posters on the spaces allotted to them, open to exhibition by any
        visitors. Everybody was grabbing this opportunity to see each other’s
        models and initiate discussions. Our model had arrived late in the
        evening, and so, we failed to exhibit it. Since, there wasn’t any other
        event that day, we decided to return to our hotel by walking, to enjoy
        the cool breeze and mesmerizing views of classical SF architecture under
        nightlights. On the next day, I had to give an oral presentation on the
        building’s design, which was supposed to be evaluated. My turn was at
        around 11 AM, and so I was rehearsing for it right from early morning.
        After I completed my presentation, I witnessed the one’s from students
        of other universities, only to get impressed by their standards. I
        talked to the participant who had given the best presentation on some
        later day, who mentioned about the crazy amount of rehearsal he’d done
        to bring that sort of performance. The third day was the biggie-the
        shaking day. Ours was scheduled at the very beginning in the list. We
        had to attach loads to the building by ourselves before they took it on
        the shake table, within a specified time limit. Since, we were only two,
        and it wouldn’t have been possible by us. We were graced by the students
        of UofT, who generously proposed to help us with the task. The big
        moment had now arrived, when not only us two, but also, our facad Prof
        Meera Raghunanthan along with the team members, who were sitting in
        front of the projector screen at Mumbai, couldn’t blink their eyes
        before witnessing it. Even my family had gathered to watch me over
        YouTube. After the two shakings, our building was tagged survived with a
        close call. It was a moment of relief of the pressure which had soared
        over the last few minutes. Mr. Ashraf Habbibullah, the CEO of CSI
        congratulated us with his words- “A big hand, big hand, for the team of
        two, all the way from India!”. It was a moment of immense pride for our
        department. During the breaks, he would just throw of dozens of latest
        iPads to the lucky ticket winners (sadly weren’t lucky enough :( ).
        After disposing our structure, we witnessed the testing of other
        structures and discussed on their performances. The hot topic there was,
        the damper, which was an optional feature allowable to be attached on
        structures only for the very first ever time. The shake day was followed
        by a grand celebration party, sponsored by CSI. There, we got to taste
        variety of continental food, tried creative poses with our new mates
        from UofT on the instant photo printing camera, and danced out crazy
        steps. Everybody enjoyed with the motive to leave behind the
        disappointments and only take learnings forward, which Mr. Ashraf titled
        as, celebrating young structural engineers. The prize ceremony followed
        the next day, where the winners were announced, after which everybody
        was bidding goodbyes to their recently built acquaintances. Later that
        day in the evening, one of my cousins who lives in SF came to receive us
        and took us for a drive through the city. Two of the places worth
        mentioning where we visited are- the Golden Gate Bridge and the Stanford
        University. Next day, he dropped us to the airport and we boarded the
        return flight, reaching back to Mumbai on 16th April.

      {/* Takeaways and Learnings */}
      <h2>My Takeaways and Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to break this into two parts-technical and non-technical.
        Technically, I got exposed to the field of Earthquake Engineering. Which
        formed the major reason why I now appreciate earthquake resistant design
        even more and take deep interest in it during my courses, or whenever I
        come across any news of earthquakes. I also, discovered my immense
        potential in problem solving, by seeing my solutions work out
        successfully, even with the most basic knowledge gained from high school
        or the courses taken up at college until 3rd year. The tinkering I did
        while working in TL and operating the shake table, made me realise the
        immense patience, that is required to handle machinery. Alongside the
        technical learnings, I would not give less importance to the team
        working and leadership skills I developed here. During the
        year-and-a-half, I became aware of not only the advantages, but also
        challenges of working together. It expanded my horizons and pushed me
        out of the shell, where I used to keep me occupied all by myself. So,
        all in all, the experience gained from here will have a long-lasting
        impact on me, and, whenever in need, I can recall back to these
        experiences so vivid, to assist myself.
      </p>

      {/* Who Should Join */}
      <h2>Who Should Join?</h2>
      <p>
        If you genuinely wish to explore the core field, I would strongly
        suggest you to join the team. The competition offers you a holistic
        package of experience valuable to both industry and research. The
        various skills you can develop here are- learning software modelling,
        getting accustomed to the challenges in construction while doing it with
        your own hands, performing experiments, and researching on unexplored
        concepts & techniques to improve the ongoing practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you commit to the team and create an impact during your presence, you
        can get a Letter of Recommendation from the faculty advisor, which will
        add value to your profile while applying for Masters or PhD in
        universities abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, even if you are not interested in higher studies or long-term
        commitment, you can choose to take up an interesting project
        contributing towards technical enhancement for the team, to show up on
        your resume.
      </p>

      {/* Selection Process */}
      <h2>Selection Process</h2>
      <p>
        Of all the technical teams in the institute, you’ll find the most
        difficult to get yourself rejected here! Freshers are free to choose to
        volunteer anytime. There is a formal selection process in place
        involving an assignment and an interview for higher years. Sophomores
        are mainly assessed on whether they can commit adequate time to the team
        or not, i.e. they should have manageable workload during the semester.
        For thirdies, the process is more rigorous since they are assigned with
        responsible roles.
      </p>

      {/* Fun */}
      <h2>Fun: Make Different Poses to Take Photos with the Model!</h2>
      <p>
        I feel pride in leading the team in its building up phase and handing
        over at a progressed state to the future team.
