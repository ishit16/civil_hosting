      "The course was presented in an engaging manner, with the professor incorporating real-life examples to make it interesting. A 3000-word essay on any topic covered in the lectures carried 20 marks, while attendance and quizzes each accounted for 10 marks, midterms for 40, and the final exam for 20. Slides and reading materials were provided, with most quiz and midterm questions being based on the slides, and a few from the reading materials in the final exam. The material covered after the midterms was not included in the final exam. The slides were somewhat challenging to comprehend due to the inclusion of complex phrases quoted by historical figures, but using ChatGPT to explain them made it more accessible. An AA grade was awarded for 75+ marks, and an AB for 65+ marks.",

      "so the start of the course we were introduced to three subsystems- healthcare , smart systems , AI ML . I picked the healthcare domain  where I did the project. time in the class will probably stand still , so take your laptop with you. our sir in the healthcare domain was excellent at making the time stay still. a one hour class could easily feel like you sat there for an eternity. there is no point in impressing him as your grade is a mix of mainly project ( two parts submission) and midsem and endsem( both open book). now the problem comes in the project. it is too time consuming can take up if your in your last year. the effort that you put in is not worth it for an elective. It's advisable to take something else and maybe take it in the last sem. they give you a problem statement and your idea is the startup which you build on. please take the course only if you have genuine enthu for entrepreneurship otherwise listening to the prof becomes hell.
