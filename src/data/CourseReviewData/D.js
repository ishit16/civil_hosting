        "I already had a very surface-level knowledge about Ocean Engineering Specialisation as my dad is in the Navy. Thus, I was exposed to some concepts as I had seen them in real life. Additionally, the specialization was not included as part of the core coursework, so it was something new.",

        "CE 410 is a unique course as it is the only introductory course for a specialization not included as part of the core syllabus. I would highly recommend it to those of you looking to explore something new in the department. The course is essentially an introduction to Offshore Engineering. The first few lectures introduce the offshore environment and some key introductory aspects. The linear wave theory is taught till the mid sem. Post this, wave transformation phenomena such as shoaling, diffraction etc., are introduced along with some higher-order wave theories. After this, methods of calculating wave forces are taught along with Morrison's Equation and calculating forces due to slamming and other conditions. The final part deals with some practical engineering aspects, such as mooring lines, anchoring, and submarine pipelines. The grading policy was as follows:- Quizzes were 10% each, with Midsem having 30% and Endsem having 40% and 10% for Class Participation The course has a good mix of practical and theoretical understanding. It can get a little heavy on the memorizing portion towards the end as a substantial amount of content is covered in the final portion, but otherwise, it is quite interesting, unique, and fun.",

        "I will start with a disclaimer, if you are fearful of either algebra, calculus, PDEs or some form of programming, this course is probably not for you as the course leans heavily into all of these topics. But with that out of the way, for those of you that are either curious about what FEM and FDM are (a form of this is covered towards to the end of CE 317) then this is the course for you. The course is especially useful for those of you using any CFD, structural analysis, hydrological modelling or soil modelling tool as they majorly employ either the FEM or FDM scheme (some softwares also use BEM and Meshfree methods) and will help you gain a better understanding of the theoretical aspect behind these softwares. You will also need Prof Eldho's approval for the course as the commitment required is quite high.\n\nIn terms of what is covered you will start by learning methods of solving a simultaneous system of algebraic equations followed by solving ODE and PDEs (similar to what was seen in MA 207) and system of PDEs. With this basis the FDM is introduced with various spatial-temporal discretisation methods being introduced along with various explicit and implicit schemes for the FDM followed by approximate methods such as the Galerkin and Raleigh-Ritz methods. \n\nAfter this the FEM is introduced. It starts with the same exercise of domain discretisation and grid generation is taught followed by formulation of element matrices and its global assembly (similar to CE 317) and then application of FEM to various problems like Structural, Hydrological etc are dealt with. \n\nThe course ends with introduction to the Boundary Element Method and Meshfree methods, followed by FDM and FEM software demonstrations via GMS.\nThe grading policy was as follows:- 3 Open Text Book Quizzes - 10% each, Midsem - 20%, Assignments - 20% and Endsem - 30%\n\nThe assignments are Programming based (done on Matlab) and using GMS, the FEM/FDM tool introduced in class",

        "This course is relatively easy in terms of the content taught, but the difficulty arises due to having to memorise a lot of content. The course is very content-heavy as it deals with key aspects taken into account while designing various different marine structures and their subcomponents. Similar to other design courses, there are various considerations and formulas that are used directly from the code of design of ports and harbours, IS 4651. However, it is much easier to understand why specific terms are incorporated in a formula, and they are easy to remember. Additionally, the design guidelines are easy to understand as to why certain configurations are followed and are designed in that manner. The course is divided into eight modules. Modules 1 and 2 are introductory modules, which act as an introduction to various marine structures in the Coastal, Port and Harbour environment. Modules 3 and 4 deal with the design and layout of ports and harbours and their subcomponents, such as jetties, fenders etc. Module 5 is about various coastal protection methods and talks in great detail about the design of breakwaters and seawalls and the calculation of forces which act on structures in the marine environment. Module 6 dealt with drydocks and their sub-components. Module 7 deals with Soil-Structure Interaction and ground improvement techniques used. Module 8 deals with the maintenance, rehabilitation and repair of marine structures. Unfortunately, the code is not provided during the exams; necessary tables and data are provided. There was a term project as well, which was done in pairs (decided by the professor), for which a report had to be made on a given topic along with a final presentation.

There may be surprise quizzes, and assignments will be given too. Corrosion covers a major part of the content . There will be numerous chemical equations and reactions throughout the course. Fundamnetals should be very clear as it will be tested thoroughly in the exams. Pay attention during class, as slides will help but not upto that extent.

      "Please give a detailed review of the course (adding general advice, your overall expereince and some tips would help greatly)": "This exciting course deals with conventional and new marine energy systems. It starts with an introduction to physical oceanography and various ocean processes related to Wind, Waves, Tides and Currents. An in-depth discussion on the resource assessment and various devices for Wave Energy, Tidal Energy, Offshore Wind Energy and Ocean Thermal Energy are covered, including device arrays. The practical design aspects are NOT covered; only the theoretical design, design principles and potential energy capture are covered. The course ends with a discussion on Environmental and Social Impacts. \n\nThe evaluation for the course was as follows:- Attendance (5%), Class Project (20%), Assignment (20%), Mid Semester (20%) and End Semester (35%). Exams were a mix of MCQs, Fill in the blanks etc. and were not difficult. No quizzes were held, and a significant focus was on assignments and the project, with the last few lectures being given off to work on the project. MIKE 21, a 2D marine modelling software for hydrodynamics etc., was taught in the class, and the assignments were based on it. \n\nThe project was a group project where you had to completely design, test and prepare a working model of a renewable energy device of your choice. An initial plan was to be presented before the midsem covering the device selection, fabrication materials, design process etc. Post midsem, you are expected to start building the prototype (the Ocean Engineering Lab staff extensively helps fabricate the models) with update meets in between. After this, a final report was prepared, and a presentation was given discussing your project and results. Some components of the marks for the project were individual, while others were assigned to the whole group. We built a working model of an Oscillating Wave Surge Converter and tested it in the Ocean Engineering Lab Wave Flume.\n\nI highly recommend this course to anyone intrigued by Marine and Offshore Engineering and wanting to explore a new and upcoming field. However, this is a 7XX course, and you will be doing this course with M.Tech, PHDs and Project Staffs (I was the only B.Tech student), and the professor's expectation is also higher.",

The quizzes had MCQs, Fill in the blanks and Numerical type question.
