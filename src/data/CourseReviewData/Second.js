You are required to have atleast 80% attendance to clear out yourselves from DX grade. An unsaid criteria of class participation is definitely a thing. Arpita Ma'am wants good class participation from the students and those who are pretty attentive for the same get the unfair advantage of it in the grading. \nThis year Arpita Ma'am did put on an eligibility criteria for giving the midsems. It was made clear by her that atleast 40% attendance and a minimum threshold of the marks must be aquired by the student to be eligible to give midsems. However, she later dismissed this and allowed everyone to give the midsems. Needless to say, course requires a decent time committment to practise problems and learn new stuff if you haven't studied these artifical intelligence algorithms before. Its adviced to stay regular in the class as problems solved in the class help a lot in the conceptual build up of the topic being discussed. ",

Similarly, focusing on the appropriate chapters from \"Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis\" before the Endsem exam yielded excellent results, with many questions appearing directly from the textbook. Additionally, keeping up with the \"ISL with Python\" material throughout the semester provided a strong foundation for the surprise quizzes.\nBy consistently attending classes and diligently studying the suggested resources, I was able to achieve an AB grade in the course",
