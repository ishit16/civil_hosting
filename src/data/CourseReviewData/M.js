Recorded lectures of the course, presented by a different professor, will also be provided which will give better insight into the course. It is essential to watch the recorded lectures, and attending class will provide insight into approaching questions effectively. Two quizzes, midterms, and final exams were conducted. The questions were of a high standard and required practice, so solving tutorial questions is recommended to achieve a good score.\n\n ",

      "The course was pretty much straight forward and easy to follow if one attended the lectures. It started with some basic concepts of network and it's history. We then went through the idea of data transfer and its various medium. There were discussions on wired and wireless mediums. It later went deep into the algorithms and optimisation techniques that are used to transfer the data. However, the mathematical aspect of these were mostly superficial or completely absent. One important point is that this course is a theoretical one and involves close to zero coding. The assignments were rather interesting and open ended and were not exactly related to what was being taught in class. There were two quizes apart from mid sem and end semester exam. These exams were mostly similar to the previous year papers. The grading was okayish. Since there was no mandatory attendance, the attendance dropped sharpy after a few weeks. Overall, a decent course if you want to get started with networks.",
